# Tools

The Tools page consists of two separate pieces of content:

## Tools

The descriptions for each tool can be edited in the [`/content/tools`](/content/tools) folder.

To edit a tool:

1. Find the `.json` file representing the tool and edit the content.
2. [Publish the website](/docs/publish.md)

## Contributions

_TODO: Explain how to update contributions and run the content script_

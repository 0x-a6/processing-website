# Examples

Examples are `.mdx` files that can be edited as explained in the [markdown pages](/docs/markdown-pages.md) guide. However, here's a bit more information that applies specifically to the examples.

## Cover image

Each example has to have a cover image for the index named liked the example file with a `16:9` ratio (minimum width 288px) and a cover image named `Cover.png\.jpg` for the homepage with 1:1 ratio (minimum width 600px) placed in the same folder.

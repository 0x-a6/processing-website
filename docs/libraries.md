# Libraries

The Libraries page consists of two separate pieces of content:

## Libraries

Each reference for a core library is created by combining a `.mdx` file (for the top text) and a set of `.json` files exported directly from the source code.

To edit a core library page:

1. Edit the markdown file as explained in the [markdown pages guide](/docs/markdown-pages.md)
2. If needed, edit the source code of the core library to change the function descriptions
3. If needed, [run the content script](/docs/content-script.md) to pull in the changes from the source code
4. [Publish the website](/docs/publish.md)

## Contributions

_TODO: Explain how to update contributions and run the content script_

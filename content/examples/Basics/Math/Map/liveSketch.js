/**
 * Map.
 *
 * Use the map() function to take any number and scale it to a new number
 * that is more useful for the project that you are working on. For example, use the
 * numbers from the mouse position to control the size or color of a shape.
 * In this example, the mouseâ€™s x-coordinate (numbers between 0 and 360) are scaled to
 * new numbers to define the color and size of a circle.

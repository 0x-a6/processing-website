  "description": "If you don't direction state the order in which an expression is evaluated, it is decided by the operator precedence. For example, in the expression 4+2*8, the 2 will first be multiplied by 8 and then the result will be added to 4. This is because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition. To avoid ambiguity in reading the program, it is recommended to write the expression as 4+(2*8). The order of evaluation can be controlled through adding parenthesis in the code. ",

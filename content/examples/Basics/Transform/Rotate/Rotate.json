  "description": "Rotating a square around the Z axis. To get the results\n  you expect, send the rotate function angle parameters that are\n  values between 0 and PI2 (TWO_PI which is roughly 6.28). If you prefer to \n  think about angles as degrees (0-360), you can use the radians() \n  method to convert your values. For example: scale(radians(90))\n  is identical to the statement scale(PI/2).",

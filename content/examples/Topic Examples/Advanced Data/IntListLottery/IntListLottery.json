  "description": "This example demonstrates an IntList can be used to store a list of numbers.\n  While an array of integers serves a similar purpose it is of fixed size.  The\n  An IntList can easily have values added or deleted and it can also be \n  shuffled and sorted.  For lists of floats or Strings, you can use FloatList\n  and StringList.  For lists of objects, use ArrayList.\n\n  In this example, three lists of integers are created.  One is a pool of numbers\n  that is shuffled and picked randomly from.  One is the list of \"picked\" numbers.\n  And one is a lottery \"ticket\" which includes 5 numbers that are trying to be matched.",

The second edition of Learning Processing has been updated for compatibility with Processing 3 and includes several new chapters of content including video, sound, data visualization, and networking. For more, visit the [Learning Processing website](http://www.learningprocessing.com/).

Dan Shiffman says, "This book tells a story. It's a story of liberation, of taking the first steps towards understanding the foundations of computing, writing your own code, and creating your own media without the bonds of existing software tools. This story is not reserved for computer scientists and engineers. This story is for you."

The publisher says, "This book teaches the basic building blocks of programming needed to create cutting-edge graphics applications including interactive art, live video processing, and data visualization. A unique lab-style manual, this book gives graphic and web designers, artists, illustrators, and anyone interested in learning to code a jumpstart on working with the Processing programming environment by providing instruction on the basic principles of the language, followed by careful explanations of advanced techniques."

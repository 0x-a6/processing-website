During the 50‘s ”era of cybernetics“, computer entered into the history of art simultaneously in different parts of the world. Art and science were in great turmoil. Science, with its theories and experiments, was approaching artificially mimicking both natural phenomena, such as light and sound, and the human phenomena of language and communication. Art, with its aesthetic and exhibitions, had transcended the boundaries of the avant-garde. Now, with the computer, it was confronting a reality that challenged ”the where“ and ”the how“ of doing art and the very meaning of ”masterpiece“. Antonio Rollo takes us on a tour of these seminal works from his unique perspective of the artist, through the code!

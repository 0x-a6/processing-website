  "description": "Modifies the quality of forms created with <b>curve()</b> and\n <b>curveVertex()</b>. The parameter <b>tightness</b> determines how the curve\n fits to the vertex points. The value 0.0 is the default value for\n <b>tightness</b> (this value defines the curves to be Catmull-Rom splines)\n and the value 1.0 connects all the points with straight lines. Values within\n the range -5.0 and 5.0 will deform the curves but will leave them\n recognizable and as values increase in magnitude, they will continue to\n deform.",

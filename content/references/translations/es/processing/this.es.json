  "description": "Refers to the current object (i.e., \"this object\"), which will change depending on the context in which <b>this</b> is referenced. In Processing, it's most common to use <b>this</b> to pass a reference from the current object into one of the libraries.<br />\n<br />\nThe keyword <b>this</b> can also be used to reference an object's own method from within itself, but such usage is typically not necessary. For example, if you are calling the <b>filter()</b> method of a <b>PImage</b> object named <b>tree</b> from another object, you would write <b>tree.filter()</b>. To call this method inside the PImage object itself, one could simply write <b>filter()</b> or, more explicitly, <b>this.filter()</b>. The additional level of specificity in <b>this.filter()</b> is not necessary, as it is always implied.\n",

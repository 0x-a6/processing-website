  "description": "This event function is run when a new movie frame is available. Use the <b>read()</b> method to capture this frame. If there is more than one movie in the program, <b>movieEvent()</b> is called each time any of the movies has a new frame available. Use an <b>if</b> to determine which movie is triggering the event. See the above example for implementation details.\n<br /><br />\nThis function is for people who want to process the image data separately from drawing (and as quickly as possible.) You cannot draw to the screen inside the <b>movieEvent()</b> function. If you want to draw immediately based on the new image, then use the <b>Movie.available()</b> method.\n",

  "description": "This event function is run when a new camera frame is available. Use the <b>read()</b> method to capture this frame. If there is more than one capture device in the program, <b>captureEvent()</b> is called each time any of the devices has a new frame available. Use an <b>if</b> within the function to determine which device is triggering the event.\n<br /><br />\nThis function is for people who want to process the image data separately from drawing (and as quickly as possible.) You cannot draw to the screen inside the <b>captureEvent()</b> function. If you want to draw immediately based on the new image, then use the <b>Capture.available()</b> method.\n",

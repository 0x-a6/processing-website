  "description": "Calls a function when the value of an input pin changes<br/>\n  <br/>\n  The sketch method provided must accept a single integer (int) parameter, which is the\n  number of the GPIO pin that the interrupt occured on. As this method might be called\n  at any time, including when drawing to the display window isn't permitted, it is best\n  to only set simple variables that are being responded to in the next draw() call, as\n  shown above. Calling functions of the Hardware I/O library at this point is certainly\n  possible.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  The mode parameter determines when the function will be called: GPIO.FALLING occurs \n  when the level changes from high to low, GPIO.RISING when the level changes from low\n  to high, and GPIO.CHANGE when either occurs.",

  "description": "Executes the code within <b>draw()</b> one time. This functions allows the\n program to update the display window only when necessary, for example when an\n event registered by <b>mousePressed()</b> or <b>keyPressed()</b> occurs.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n In structuring a program, it only makes sense to call redraw() within events\n such as <b>mousePressed()</b>. This is because <b>redraw()</b> does not run\n <b>draw()</b> immediately (it only sets a flag that indicates an update is\n needed). <br/>\n <br/>\n The <b>redraw()</b> function does not work properly when called inside\n <b>draw()</b>. To enable/disable animations, use <b>loop()</b> and\n <b>noLoop()</b>.",

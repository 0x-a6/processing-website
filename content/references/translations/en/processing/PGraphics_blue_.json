  "description": "Extracts the blue value from a color, scaled to match current\n <b>colorMode()</b>. The value is always returned as a float, so be careful\n not to assign it to an int value.<br />\n <br />\n The <b>blue()</b> function is easy to use and understand, but it is slower\n than a technique called bit masking. When working in <b>colorMode(RGB,\n 255)</b>, you can acheive the same results as <b>blue()</b> but with greater\n speed by using a bit mask to remove the other color components. For example,\n the following two lines of code are equivalent means of getting the blue\n value of the color value <b>c</b>:<br />\n <br />\n \n <pre>\n float b1 = blue(c); // Simpler, but slower to calculate\n float b2 = c & 0xFF; // Very fast to calculate\n </pre>",

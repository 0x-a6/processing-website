  "description": "Pops the current transformation matrix off the matrix stack.\n Understanding pushing and popping requires understanding the concept of\n a matrix stack. The <b>pushMatrix()</b> function saves the current\n coordinate system to the stack and <b>popMatrix()</b> restores the prior\n coordinate system. <b>pushMatrix()</b> and <b>popMatrix()</b> are used\n in conjuction with the other transformation functions and may be\n embedded to control the scope of the transformations.",

The value 0.0 is the default value for\n <b>tightness</b> (this value defines the curves to be Catmull-Rom splines)\n and the value 1.0 connects all the points with straight lines. Values within\n the range -5.0 and 5.0 will deform the curves but will leave them\n recognizable and as values increase in magnitude, they will continue to\n deform.",

  "description": "When <b>pixelDensity(2)</d> is used to make use of a high resolution\n display (called a Retina display on OS X or high-dpi on Windows and\n Linux), the width and height of the sketch do not change, but the\n number of pixels is doubled. As a result, all operations that use pixels\n (like <b>loadPixels()</b>, <b>get()</b>, <b>set()</b>, etc.) happen\n in this doubled space. As a convenience, the variables <b>pixelWidth</b>\n and <b>pixelHeight<b> hold the actual width and height of the sketch\n in pixels. This is useful for any sketch that uses the <b>pixels[]</b>\n array, for instance, because the number of elements in the array will\n be <b>pixelWidth*pixelHeight</b>, not <b>width*height</b>.",

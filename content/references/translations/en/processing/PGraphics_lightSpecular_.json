Specular refers to\n light which bounces off a surface in a perferred direction (rather than\n bouncing in all directions like a diffuse light) and is used for\n creating highlights. The specular quality of a light interacts with the\n specular material qualities set through the <b>specular()</b> and\n <b>shininess()</b> functions.",

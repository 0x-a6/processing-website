There are many different types of variables (int, floats, strings, etc.) and the assignment operator can only assign values which are the same type as the variable it is assigning. For example, if the variable is of type <b>int</b>, the value must also be an <b>int</b>.\n","related":[],"syntax":["var = value"],"returns":"","type":"function","category":"structure","subcategory":"","parameters":[{"name":"var","description":"any valid variable name","type":[]},{"name":"value","description":"any value of the same type as the variable.

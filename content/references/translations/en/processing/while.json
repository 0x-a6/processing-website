  "description": "Controls a sequence of repetitions. The <b>while</b> structure executes a series of statements continuously while the <b>expression</b> is <b>true</b>. The expression must be updated during the repetitions or the program will never \"break out\" of <b>while</b>.\n<br /> <br />\nThis function can be dangerous because the code inside the <b>while</b> loop will not finish until the expression inside <b>while</b> becomes false. It will lock out all other code from running (e.g., mouse and keyboard events will not be updated). Be careful &mdash; if used incorrectly, this can lock up your code (and sometimes even the Processing environment itself).\n",

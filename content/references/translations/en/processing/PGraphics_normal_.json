  "description": "Sets the current normal vector. Used for drawing three dimensional shapes and\n surfaces, <b>normal()</b> specifies a vector perpendicular to a shape's\n surface which, in turn, determines how lighting affects it. Processing\n attempts to automatically assign normals to shapes, but since that's\n imperfect, this is a better option when you want more control. This function\n is identical to <b>glNormal3f()</b> in OpenGL.",

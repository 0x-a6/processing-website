The shader file must be \n loaded in the sketch's \"data\" folder/directory to load correctly. \n Shaders are compatible with the P2D and P3D renderers, but not \n with the default renderer.<br />\n <br />\n Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local \n computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on \n Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename \n parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.<br />\n <br />\n If the file is not available or an error occurs, <b>null</b> will \n be returned and an error message will be printed to the console. \n The error message does not halt the program, however the null \n value may cause a NullPointerException if your code does not check \n whether the value returned is null.<br />",

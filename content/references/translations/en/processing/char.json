  "description": "Datatype for characters, typographic symbols such as A, d, and $. A <b>char</b> stores letters and symbols in the Unicode format, a coding system developed to support a variety of world languages. Each <b>char</b> is two bytes (16 bits) in length and is distinguished by surrounding it with single quotes. Character escapes may also stored as a <b>char</b>. For example, the representation for the \"delete\" key is 127. The first time a variable is written, it must be declared with a statement expressing its datatype. Subsequent uses of this variable must not reference the datatype because Processing will think the variable is being declared again.\n",

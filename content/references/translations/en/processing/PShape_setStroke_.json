  "description": "The <b>setStroke()</b> method defines the outline color of a <b>PShape</b>.\n This method is used after shapes are created or when a shape is defined\n explicitly (e.g. <b>createShape(RECT, 20, 20, 80, 80)</b>) as shown in\n the above example. When a shape is created with <b>beginShape()</b> and\n <b>endShape()</b>, its attributes may be changed with <b>fill()</b> and\n <b>stroke()</b> within <b>beginShape()</b> and <b>endShape()</b>.\n However, after the shape is created, only the <b>setStroke()</b> method\n can define a new stroke value for the <b>PShape</b>.",

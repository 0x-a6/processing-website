  "description": "Datatype for floating-point numbers larger than those that can be stored in a <b>float</b>. A <b>float</b> is a 32-bit values that can be as large as 3.40282347E+38 and as low as -3.40282347E+38. A <b>double</b> can be used similarly to a float, but can have a greater magnitude because it's a 64-bit number. Processing functions don't use this datatype, so while they work in the language, you'll usually have to convert to a <b>float</b> using the <b>(float)</b> syntax before passing into a function.",

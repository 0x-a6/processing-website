  "description": "Modifies the location from which rectangles are drawn by changing the way in\n which parameters given to <b>rect()</b> are interpreted.<br />\n <br />\n The default mode is <b>rectMode(CORNER)</b>, which interprets the first two\n parameters of <b>rect()</b> as the upper-left corner of the shape, while the\n third and fourth parameters are its width and height.<br />\n <br />\n <b>rectMode(CORNERS)</b> interprets the first two parameters of <b>rect()</b>\n as the location of one corner, and the third and fourth parameters as the\n location of the opposite corner.<br />\n <br />\n <b>rectMode(CENTER)</b> interprets the first two parameters of <b>rect()</b>\n as the shape's center point, while the third and fourth parameters are its\n width and height.<br />\n <br />\n <b>rectMode(RADIUS)</b> also uses the first two parameters of <b>rect()</b>\n as the shape's center point, but uses the third and fourth parameters to\n specify half of the shape's width and height.<br />\n <br />\n The parameter must be written in ALL CAPS because Processing is a\n case-sensitive language.",

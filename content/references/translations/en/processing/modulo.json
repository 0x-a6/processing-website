{"name":"% (modulo)","brief":"Calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another","description":"Calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, when 52.1 is divided by 10, the divisor (10) goes into the dividend (52.1) five times (5 * 10 == 50), and there is a remainder of 2.1 (52.1 - 50 == 2.1). Thus, <strong>52.1 % 10</strong> produces <strong>2.1</strong>.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that when the divisor is greater than the dividend, the remainder constitutes the value of the entire dividend. That is, a number cannot be divided by any number larger than itself. For example, when 9 is divided by 10, the result is zero with a remainder of 9. Thus, <strong>9 % 10</strong> produces <strong>9</strong>.<br/>\n<br/>\nModulo is extremely useful for ensuring values stay within a boundary, such as when keeping a shape on the screen. (See the second example above.)\n","related":[],"syntax":["value1 % value2"],"returns":"int or float","type":"function","category":"math","subcategory":"Operators","parameters":[{"name":"value1","description":"int or float","type":[]},{"name":"value2","description":"int or float","type":[]}]}

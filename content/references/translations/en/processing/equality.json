  "description": "Determines if two values are equivalent. Please note the equality operator (==) is different from the assignment operator (=) and although they look similar, they have a different use. If you're comparing two variables, the equality operator (==) only works with primitive data types like int, boolean, and char. It doesn't work with composite data types like Array, Table, and PVector.<br /> \n<br />\nNote that when comparing String objects, you must use the <b>equals()</b> method instead of ==. See the reference for String or the <a href=\"https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Troubleshooting#why-dont-these-strings-equal\">troubleshooting</a> note for more explanation.<br /> \n<br />\n",

This function may only be used\n between <b>beginShape()</b> and <b>endShape()</b> and only when there is\n no MODE parameter specified to <b>beginShape()</b>. The first and last\n points in a series of <b>curveVertex()</b> lines will be used to guide\n the beginning and end of a the curve. A minimum of four points is\n required to draw a tiny curve between the second and third points.\n Adding a fifth point with <b>curveVertex()</b> will draw the curve\n between the second, third, and fourth points. The <b>curveVertex()</b>\n function is an implementation of Catmull-Rom splines. Using the 3D\n version requires rendering with P3D (see the Environment reference for\n more information).",

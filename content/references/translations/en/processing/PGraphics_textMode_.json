  "description": "Sets the way text draws to the screen, either as texture maps or as vector\n geometry. The default <b>textMode(MODEL)</b>, uses textures to render the\n fonts. The <b>textMode(SHAPE)</b> mode draws text using the glyph outlines of\n individual characters rather than as textures. This mode is only supported\n with the <b>PDF</b> and <b>P3D</b> renderer settings. With the <b>PDF</b>\n renderer, you must call <b>textMode(SHAPE)</b> before any other drawing\n occurs. If the outlines are not available, then <b>textMode(SHAPE)</b> will\n be ignored and <b>textMode(MODEL)</b> will be used instead.<br />\n <br />\n The <b>textMode(SHAPE)</b> option in <b>P3D</b> can be combined with\n <b>beginRaw()</b> to write vector-accurate text to 2D and 3D output files,\n for instance <b>DXF</b> or <b>PDF</b>. The <b>SHAPE</b> mode is not currently\n optimized for <b>P3D</b>, so if recording shape data, use\n <b>textMode(MODEL)</b> until you're ready to capture the geometry with\n <b>beginRaw()</b>.",

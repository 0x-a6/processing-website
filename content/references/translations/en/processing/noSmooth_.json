  "description": "Draws all geometry and fonts with jagged (aliased)\n edges and images with hard edges between the pixels\n when enlarged rather than interpolating pixels. Note\n that smooth() is active by default, so it is necessary\n to call noSmooth() to disable smoothing of geometry,\n fonts, and images. Since the release of Processing 3.0,\n the noSmooth() function can only be run once for each\n sketch, either at the top of a sketch without a setup(),\n or after the size() function when used in a sketch with\n setup(). See the examples above for both scenarios.",

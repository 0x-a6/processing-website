  "description": "( begin auto-generated from draw.xml )\n\n Called directly after <b>setup()</b> and continuously executes the lines\n of code contained inside its block until the program is stopped or\n <b>noLoop()</b> is called. The <b>draw()</b> function is called\n automatically and should never be called explicitly. It should always be\n controlled with <b>noLoop()</b>, <b>redraw()</b> and <b>loop()</b>.\n After <b>noLoop()</b> stops the code in <b>draw()</b> from executing,\n <b>redraw()</b> causes the code inside <b>draw()</b> to execute once and\n <b>loop()</b> will causes the code inside <b>draw()</b> to execute\n continuously again. The number of times <b>draw()</b> executes in each\n second may be controlled with <b>frameRate()</b> function.\n There can only be one <b>draw()</b> function for each sketch\n and <b>draw()</b> must exist if you want the code to run continuously or\n to process events such as <b>mousePressed()</b>. Sometimes, you might\n have an empty call to <b>draw()</b> in your program as shown in the\n above example.\n\n ( end auto-generated )",

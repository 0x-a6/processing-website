## Video de

The Video library plays movie files and captures video data from a camera. Video can be captured from USB Cameras, IEEE 1394 (Firewire) Cameras, or Video Cards with composite or S-video input devices connected to the computer. Movies can be loaded from files located on your computer or anywhere on the Internet. It is based on the GStreamer multimedia framework, and uses the gstreamer-java bindings to interface GStreamer from Java to support a wide range of media formats. We recommend using H.264, but many other formats will work as well.

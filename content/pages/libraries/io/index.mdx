## Hardware I/O

The Hardware I/O library allows access to the computer's hardware periperals, such as digital inputs and outputs, serial busses, and the like, in a fashion similar to the Arduino plaform. This library is only available for embedded Linux boards with the necessary kernel drivers, such as the Raspberry Pi.

The source code is available on the processing GitHub repository. Please report bugs here.

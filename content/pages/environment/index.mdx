## Overview

The Processing Development Environment (PDE) makes it easy to write Processing programs. Programs are written in the Text Editor and started by pressing the Run button. In Processing, a computer program is called a _sketch_. Sketches are stored in the _Sketchbook_, which is a folder on your computer. It's easy to open the sketches by clicking on the Open button.

Sketches can draw two- and three-dimensional graphics. The default renderer is for drawing two-dimensional graphics. The P3D renderer makes it possible to draw three-dimensional graphics, which includes controlling the camera, lighting, and materials. The P2D renderer is a fast, but last accurate renderer for drawing two-dimensional graphics. Both the P2D and P3D renderers are accelerated if your computer has an OpenGL compatible graphics card.

The capabilities of Processing are extended with _Libraries_ and _Tools_.
Libraries make it possible for sketches to do things beyond the _core_
Processing code. There are hundred of libraries contributed by the Processing community
that can be added to your sketches to enable new things like playing sounds, doing computer
vision, and working with advanced 3D geometry. Tools extend the PDE to help make creating
sketches easier by providing interfaces for tasks like selecting colors.

Processing has different _programming modes_ to make it possible to deploy sketches
on different platforms and program in different ways. The current default programming modes
are _Java_ and _Experimental_. Other programming modes, such as _JavaScript_ and
_Android_, are added by selecting "Add Mode..." from the menu in the upper-right
corner of the PDE. <!--The Java mode makes Java Applications,
the JavaScript mode makes sketches that run through HTML5 Canvas and WebGL,
and the Android mode makes sketches that run on Android phones and tablets.-->

## Processing Development Environment (PDE)

The Processing Development Environment (PDE) consists of a simple text
editor for writing code, a message area, a text console, tabs for managing
files, a toolbar with buttons for common actions, and a series of menus.
The menus options change from mode to mode. The default Java mode is documented here.

<!--

There are three variations of the PDE, one for each programming mode. The menus
change a little depending if it currently in Java, JavaScript, or Android mode.
The Java and JavaScript modes are documented here. For more information about
Android mode, please visit the <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android">Processing
for Android reference</a>.
-->

Programs written using Processing are called sketches. These sketches are
written in the text editor. It has features for cutting/pasting and for
searching/replacing text. The message area gives feedback while saving and
exporting and also displays errors. The console displays text output by
Processing sketches including complete error messages and text output from
sketches with the print() and println() functions.

The buttons on the toolbar can run and stop programs, create a new sketch, open, save,
and export:

  Preferences
</h5>

The Processing Development Environment (PDE) is highly configurable. The most common
preferences can be modified in the Preferences window, located in the File menu on
Windows and Linux and in the Processing menu on Mac Os X. The full list of preferences
are stored in the "preferences.txt" file. This file can be opened and edited directly
only when Processing is not running. You can find the location of this file on your
computer by reading the bottom-left corner of the Prefereces window.

<ul>
  <li>
    _Sketchbook location_
    <br />
    Any folder can be used as the Sketchbook. Input a new location or select
    "Browse" to set the folder you want to use.
  </li>
  <li>
    _Editor font size_
    <br />
    Sets the font size of the code in the text editor. Restart Processing after
    making this change.
  </li>
  <li>
    _Use smooth text in editor window_
    <br />
    By default, the text in the editor is aliased. When checked, the editor
    switches to an anti-aliased (smoothed) font. Restart Processing after making
    this change.
  </li>
  <li>
    _Increase maximum available memory_
    <br />
    Allocates more RAM to Processing sketches when they run. Sketches that use
    media files (images, audio, etc.) sometimes require more RAM. Increase the
    amount of RAM if a sketch is throwing Out of Memory Errors.
  </li>
  <li>
    _Delete previous folder on export_
    <br />
    When checked (default behavior), Processing deletes the complete export
    folder before re-creating it and adding the new media.
  </li>
  <li>
    _Check for updates on startup_
    <br />
    When checked (default behavior), you'll be informed of new Processing
    software releases as they become available through a small dialog box that
    opens as Processing starts.
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- Sketches and Sketchbook -->

<h5 id="Sketchbook">
  <a href="#top">
    <img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" />
  </a>{' '}
  Sketches and Sketchbook
</h5>

All Processing projects are called sketches. Each sketch has its own folder. The main file
for each sketch has the same name as the folder and is found inside. For example, if the
sketch is named "Sketch_123", the folder for the sketch will be called "Sketch_123" and the
main file will be called "Sketch_123.pde". The PDE file extension is an acronym for the
Processing Development Environment.

Processing sketches can be stored anywhere on your computer, but by default they are
stored in the sketchbook, which will be in different places on your computer or network
depending if you use PC, Mac, or Linux and how the preferences are set. To locate this
folder, select the "Preferences" option from the File menu (or from the "Processing" menu
on the Mac) and look for the "Sketchbook location".

A sketch folder sometimes contains other folders for media files and other code.
When a font or image is added to a sketch by selecting "Add File..." from the Sketch menu,
a "data" folder is created. Files may also be added to your Processing sketch by dragging
them into the text editor. Image and sound files dragged into the application window will
automatically be added to the current sketch's "data" folder. All images, fonts, sounds,
and other data files loaded in the sketch must be in this folder.

<!-- Renderers -->

<h5 id="Renderers">
  <a href="#top">
    <img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" />
  </a>{' '}
  Renderers
</h5>

Processing has three built-in renderers. The default renderer is for drawing two-dimensional
shapes. _P2D_ is a faster, but less accurate renderer for drawing two-dimensional
shapes. _P3D_ is for three-dimensional geometry, it can also control
the camera, lighting, and materials. The P2D and P3D renderers are accelerated if
your computer has an OpenGL compatible graphics card.

The renderer used for each sketch is specified through the size() function.
If a renderer is not explicity defined in size(), it uses the default renderer.
For example, the following program:

<pre>void setup() {
size(200, 200);
}

void draw() {
background(204);
line(width/2, height/2, mouseX, mouseY);
}
</pre>

To change the renderer, add a third parameter to size(). For example:

<pre>void setup() {
size(200, 200, P2D);
}

void draw() {
background(204);
line(width/2, height/2, mouseX, mouseY);
}
</pre>

A large effort has been made to make the Processing renderers behave similarly across
the different renderers, but there are currently some inconsistencies that are explained
in the reference.

For more information, see the <a href="../size_.html">size()</a> reference entry.</b>

<!-- Coordinates -->

<h5 id="Coordinates">
  <a href="#top">
    <img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" />
  </a>
  Coordinates
</h5>

Processing uses a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin in the upper-left
corner. If your sketch is 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high, coordinate
(0, 0) is the upper-left pixel and coordinate (320, 240) is in the lower-right.
The last visible pixel in the lower-right corner of the screen is at position
(319, 239) because pixels are drawn to the right and below the coordinate.

<img src="images/coordinates2D3D.png" width="540" height="240" >

Using the three-dimension coordinate system of P3D, the z-coordinate is zero at the
surface of the image, with negative z-values moving back in space. When drawing in
3D, the _camera_ is positioned in the center of the screen.

<!-- Tabs, Multiples Files, and Classes -->

<h5 id="Tabs">
  <a href="#top">
    <img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" />
  </a>{' '}
  Tabs, Multiple Files, and Classes
</h5>

It can be inconvenient to write a long program within a single file.
When Processing sketches grow to hundreds or thousands of lines, breaking them
into modular units helps manage the different parts. Processing manages files with
the Sketchbook and each sketch can have multiple files that are managed with tabs.

The arrow button to the right of the tabs in the Processing Development Environment
is used to manage these files. Click this button to reveal options to create a new tab,
rename the current tab, and delete the current tab. If a project has more than one tab,
they can also be hidden and revealed. Hiding a tab temporarily removes that code
from the sketch (it will not be compiled with the sketch when you press Run).

Tabs are intended for more advanced users, and for this reason, the menu that
controls the tabs is intentionally made less prominent.

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="20" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">

<tr>
<td>
_Advanced_<br />
<br />
When a program with multiple tabs is run, the code is grouped together and the
classes in other tabs become inner classes. Because they're inner classes, they
cannot have static variables. Simply place the "static" variable outside the class
itself to do the same thing (it need not be explicitly named "static" once you list
it in this manner). If you don't want code to be an inner class, you can also create
a tab with a .java suffix, which means it will be interpreted as straight java code.
It is also not possible to use static classes in separate tabs. If you do this,
however, you'll need to pass the PApplet object to that object in that tab in order
to get PApplet functions like line(), loadStrings() or saveFrame() to work.<br />

<!-- Programming Modes -->

  </a>{' '}
  Programming Modes
</h5>

Processing has different _programming modes_ to make it possible to deploy sketches
on different platforms and program in different ways. The current default programming modes
are _Java_ and _Experimental_. Other programming modes, such as _JavaScript_ and
_Android_, are added by selecting "Add Mode..." from the menu in the upper-right
corner of the PDE. <!--The Java mode makes Java Applications,
the JavaScript mode makes sketches that run through HTML5 Canvas and WebGL,
and the Android mode makes sketches that run on Android phones and tablets.-->

<!--

_JavaScript_, and _Android_. The Java mode makes Java Applications,
the JavaScript mode makes sketches that run through HTML5 Canvas and
WebGL, and the Android mode makes sketches that run on Android phones and tablets.
Each mode has unique menu items, examples, and a distinct visual theme for the PDE.

-->

<!--

While each mode has some custom language elements, the core Processing syntax works
identically regardless of the mode and export platform. Additionally, now that the
software architecture for modes is in place, it's possible to create many other
compatible modes based on other programming and scripting languages such as Python,
and Ruby, etc.

-->

<h6>Java Mode</h6>

This mode makes it possible to write short programs to draw to the screen, but also
enables complex Java programs as well. It's can be used simply by beginners, but
it scales to professional Java software development. Sketches written in this mode can
be exported as Java Applications to run on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows operating
systems.

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="20" bgcolor="#E6E6E6">

<tr>
<td>
_Advanced_<br />
<br />
Java files with the extension .java can be included with a Java mode sketch.
They may be created directly in the PDE or copied into the sketch folder through
the "Add File..." item in the Sketch menu or dragged into the text editor. It's possible
to write any Java code in files with the .java extension. In fact, complete Java code
can be written from inside the Processing Environment by subclassing PApplet like this:

<pre>

public class MyDemo extends PApplet {
</pre>

This is for advanced developers only and is not really recommended. Using this technique
means that any additional tabs will no longer be inner classes, meaning you'll have to
do extra work to make them communicate properly with the host PApplet. It is not necessary
to use this technique just to get features of the Java language. Advanced developers can
also program with Processing in another Java Editor if higher-level code editing and
tools are needed. We've documented how to use

<a href="http://processing.org/learning/eclipse/">Processing
in Eclipse</a>, but core.jar can be used as a part of any Java project.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

{' '}

<h6>Experimental Mode</h6>

This is a prototype of a potential future version of the Processing Development Environment.
It includes features to check for errors in the code while it's written, to follow variables
as they change, to debug a program with break points, and more.

<!--
<h6>JavaScript Mode</h6>


The JavaScript Mode is built around <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a>,
a port of the Processing API to JavaScript that renders with HTML5 Canvas and WebGL.
Processing.js was originally started by John Resig and is now developed by a great team
at Seneca College led by David Humphrey.



This mode allows Processing to export Processing.js sketches directly from inside the
Processing environment to target web environments without having to worry about plugins.
Running a sketch starts a server that delivers the code directly from its export
folder. This allows you to view and test your sketch on multiple browsers and even
multiple devices if you are on a network.



When the Run button is pressed, a new local server is started and the default web
browser opens a new window with the address of the server. To make changes
to the code, navigate back to Processing and make the changes in the text editor. Save
the sketch, then navigate back to the web browser and reload the page. Press "stop" or
close the sketch window will stop the server.



If the computer is on a network the sketch can be accessed by other devices on the
network through the IP address of the computer followd by the port assigned by Processing.
Just replace "127.0.0.1" with your computer's IP address.



Similar to .java tabs in the Java mode, JavaScript files may be added to
a sketch. Create a new tab with a name ending in ".js" or drag an existing ".js" file
into the text editor of the sketch to copy it. JavaScript tabs make it possible to
write pure JavaScript code inside the PDE that can reach beyond what the Processing
language alone offers. Check the examples included with the mode to see how to
integrate JavaScript code.



JavaScript Mode is new for Processing 2.0. There's more information about this mode
on the emerging <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/JavaScript">JavaScript Mode</a>
page on the Processing Wiki.
-->

<h6>JavaScript Mode</h6>

Sketches written in this mode can be exported to run inside web browsers using
HTML5 and WebGL. This mode is documented on the <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/JavaScript">
JavaScript</a> page of the Processing Wiki. To add this mode, click on the mode
button in the upper-right corner of the PDE and select "Add Mode..."

<h6>Android Mode</h6>

Sketches written in this mode can be exported to run on Android phones and tablets.
This mode is documented on the <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android">
Processing for Android</a> page of the Processing Wiki. To add this mode, click on
the mode button in the upper-right corner of the PDE and select "Add Mode..."

<!--

<h5 id="Programming_modes">
<a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> Programming Modes
</h5>

Processing allows people to create sketches at three levels of complexity: Basic
Mode, Continuous Mode, and Java Mode. People new to programming should begin
with the Basic Mode to learn about coordinates, variables, and loops before
moving to Continuous and Java modes.


<h6>Basic</h6>
This mode is used drawing static images and learning fundamentals of programming.
Simple lines of code have a direct representation on the screen. The following
example draws a yellow rectangle on the screen:
<pre>size(200, 200);

background(255);
noStroke();
fill(255, 204, 0);
rect(30, 20, 50, 50);

</pre>

<h6>Continuous</h6>
This mode provides a setup() structure that is run once when the sketch
begins and a draw() structure which by default continually loops through
the code inside. This additional structure allows writing custom functions
and classes and using keyboard and mouse events.<br>

This example draws four circles on the screen and utilizes a custom function
called circles(). The circles() function is not a part of the Processing
language, but was written for this example. The code in draw() only runs
once because noLoop() is called in setup().
<pre>void setup() {

size(200, 200);
noStroke();
background(255);
fill(0, 102, 153, 204);
smooth();
noLoop();
}

void draw() {
circles(40, 80);
circles(90, 70);
}

void circles(int x, int y) {
ellipse(x, y, 50, 50);
ellipse(x+20, y+20, 60, 60);
}</pre>
This example draws rectangles that follow the mouse position (stored in
the system variables mouseX and mouseY). The <b>draw()</b>
block runs forever until the sketch is stopped, thus creating the
potential for motion and interaction.
<pre>void setup() {
size(200, 200);
rectMode(CENTER);
noStroke();
fill(0, 102, 153, 204);
}

void draw() {
background(255);
rect(width-mouseX, height-mouseY, 50, 50);
rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}

</pre>

<h6>Java</h6>

This mode is the most flexible, allowing complete Java code to be written from inside
the Processing Environment (as long as they're still subclasses of PApplet). This mode
is for advanced users only and is not really recommended. Using this mode means that any
additional tabs will no longer be inner classes, meaning that you'll have to do extra
work to make them communicate properly with the host PApplet. It is not necessary to use
this mode just to get features of the Java language.


<pre>public class MyDemo extends PApplet {

void setup() {
size(200, 200);

rectMode(CENTER);
noStroke();
fill(0, 102, 153, 204);

}

void draw() {
background(255);
rect(width-mouseX, height-mouseY, 50, 50);
rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}
}

</pre>

<!-- more for JAVA


It is possible to have multiple files in a single sketch. These can be Processing text
files (the extension .pde) or Java files (the extension .java). To create a new file,
click on the arrow button to the right of the file tabs. This button gives access to
creating, deleting, and renaming the files that comprise the current sketch. You can
write functions and classes in new PDE files and you can write any Java code in files
with the JAVA extension. Working with multiple files makes it easier to re-use code
and to separate sketches into small sub-programs.

  Adding Libraries, Tools, and Modes
</h5>

Processing 2.0 includes a set of new features to make it easier to install, update, and
remove Libraries, Tools, and Modes.

Add contributed libraries by selecting "Add Library..." from the "Import Library..."
submenu within the Sketch menu. Not all available libraries have been converted to
show up in "Add Library...". If a library isn't there, it will need to be installed
manually. Follow the <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library">
How to Install a Contributed Library</a> instructions on the Processing
Wiki for more information.

Add contributed tools by selecting "Add Tool..." from the Tools menu to select a Tool
to download.

Add contributed modes by selecting "Add Mode..." from the Mode menu in the upper-right
corner of the PDE.
